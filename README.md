# Health Tracker

## 💡 Inspiration
Our inspiration was to create an all in one health platfrom where people can ask for blood of a paticular blood group when needed, can self-diagnose some common diseases, read health blogs and also create/join chat rooms and interact with other random people online aiming on improving thier mental health.

## 💻 What it does

## ⚙️How we built it

- ML: Python, Skikit-Learn
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JS
- Backend: Django
- Database: CockroachDB
- Authentication: Auth0

## Use of CockroachDB

- We have used CockroachDB as a primary database because it is an easy-to-use, open-source and indestructible SQL database.

## 🔑 Auth0

- People can request for blood from thier nearest hospital and they will get a message on thier registered email-id once blood is available.

## 🧠 Challenges we ran into

- Inputting so much of the data for self diagnosis and also making this process engaging and interesting was a big challenge for us that we were able to overcome.

## 🏅 Accomplishments that we're proud of

## 📖 What we learned

We learned how to integrate ML models directly without creating an API with Django and collaboration.

## 🚀 What's next for Health Tracker

Improving the accuracy of the model.
